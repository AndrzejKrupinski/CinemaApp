Current ones:  
1) Build rest-controllers and services for models used only by admin;
2) Create separate admin route file using permissions package;
3) Create separate views for admin;
4) Turn into SPA where it's possible without much attention (i.e. creating asynchronous requests in Vue);  
5) Add admin panel and functionalities (probably also separate controllers and services);  
6) Add cinemas and movies edition;  
7) Create models for genre, etc.
